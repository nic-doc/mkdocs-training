# MKDocs Training

This repo contains a basic example of how to use mkdocs to create a documentation site. While there are many tutorials and templates out there, this one follows the experience of the author regarding best practices and settings for mkdocs.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to clone/fork this repo and use the devcontainers configuration to edit and run the site. If you don't have a local environment configured to run Docker, using GitHub Codespaces is a great alternative.
